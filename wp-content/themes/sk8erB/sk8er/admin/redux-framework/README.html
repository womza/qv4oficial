<h2 id="getting-started-with-redux">Getting Started with Redux</h2>
<p>ReduxFramework has been built from the ground up to be the most flexible framework around. You can run it as an auto-updating plugin, or embed it inside your plugin or theme. It allows for multiple copies of itself within the same WordPress instance. For a guide on getting started please refer to <a href="https://github.com/ReduxFramework/redux-framework/wiki/Getting-Started">https://github.com/ReduxFramework/redux-framework/wiki/Getting-Started</a>.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://github.com/ReduxFramework/ReduxSampleTheme">download our sample theme available here</a> to start developing right away.</p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<ol>
<li>Why should we use <code>require_once</code> instead of <code>get_template_part</code>?<ul>
<li>First, because <code>get_template_part</code> is for... you guessed it, themes! Redux is designed to work with both themes <em>and</em> plugins.</li>
<li>Second, read <a href="http://kovshenin.com/2013/get_template_part/">this</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why shouldn&#39;t we edit <code>sample-config.php</code> in the plugin directory?<ul>
<li>Because <code>sample-config.php</code> will be replaced at each update of the plugin. You will lose all your effort</li>
</ul>
</li>
